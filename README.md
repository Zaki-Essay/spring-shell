Spring Boot 3 did not use GraalVM (GraalVM is typically used for ahead-of-time compilation of JVM-based applications into native executables). 
Spring Boot continues to evolve,
GraalVM is a high-performance runtime that provides significant benefits for Java applications. Its main use cases include:

### 1. **Native Image Compilation (Ahead-of-Time - AOT Compilation)**
- Converts Java applications into native executables, reducing startup time and memory usage.
- Eliminates the need for a traditional JVM at runtime.
- Used in **Spring Boot 3** with the **Spring Native** support to create lightweight microservices.

### 2. **Improved Performance for Java Applications**
- Offers an optimized Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, improving the execution speed of Java applications.
- Replaces the default JVM JIT compiler (C2) with a more efficient Graal JIT compiler.

### 3. **Polyglot Capabilities**
- Supports multiple languages like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and R.
- Enables interoperability between languages in a single runtime.

### 4. **Cloud-Native & Serverless Applications**
- Reduces resource consumption, making it ideal for serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions).

### 5. **Security & Isolation**
- Since native images do not rely on a traditional JVM, they have a smaller attack surface.
- Can reduce vulnerabilities associated with dynamic class loading.

#### **Spring Boot 3 & GraalVM**
Spring Boot 3 has **first-class support** for GraalVM through **Spring Native**, allowing you to:
- Build native images using `GraalVM Native Image`.
- Improve cold-start performance for microservices.
- Optimize memory usage for cloud deployments.
